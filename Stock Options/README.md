The first program implements the payoff functions for a European call option and a European put option,
and plot them for a strike price of 50 $.

In the second program I found a linear combination of European put and call options which reproduces the following
payoff graph, called the butterfly spread. A butterfly spread is an options strategy combining bull and bear spreads, with a fixed risk and capped profit. 

The third and most important program implements Binomial Tree via Backward induction to calculate the Option Price of a stock at T=0.
