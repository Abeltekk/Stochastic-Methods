In the first program, I tried to plot the margin of error of the stirling approximation against the factorial of n and tried to explain the nature of the graph.

The second program plots the graph of Binomial Distribution and Gaussian Approximation under varying parameters n, p.

The third program runs a QQ Plot, a probability plot which is a graphical method for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other.
As in the case here, if both sets of quantiles came from the same distribution (binomial distribution), we should see the points forming a line that's roughly straight.
