This is a Python program which prints out an amortization schedule for a mortgage.
The program should take as input the nominal yearly interest rate r, the amount of the
loan P, the number of compounding periods per year m, and the term of the mortgage
n in years. It assumes that the mortgage is fully redeemed at the end of the term.
The program will compute the monthly payment and the effective annual interest
rate. Furthermore, it displays a detailed payment schedule, i.e., for each month
the interest and principal parts of the payment (Second and Third columns of the table), and the remaining principal (the last column).
I ran this program with designated values of P = 500 000, r = 0.02, m = 12, and n = 20 but its upto the user to assign the values as he sees fit.
